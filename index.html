                Counter-Strike (CS) is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games in which teams of terrorists battle to perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking, assassination) while counter-terrorists try to prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). The series began on Windows in 1999 with the release of the first game, Counter-Strike. It was initially released as a modification ("mod") for Half-Life that was designed by Minh "Gooseman" Le and Jess "Cliffe" Cliffe before the rights to the mod's intellectual property were acquired by Valve, the developers of Half-Life, who then turned Counter-Strike into a retail product.</p>

                 Changing your crosshair can improve your game, as the default one may not be optimal for everyone. You can greatly improve your crosshair’s visibility by tweaking some of the available settings. Your crosshair should be visible in any map environment but at the same time it should not be distracting and so big that it blocks your view.
